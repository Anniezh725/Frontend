            <h3>Introduction</h3>


        <p>I've completed my HSC in 2020 and I received an ATAR of 100+. I've had minimal to no past experience with programming before university. However I've been an engineer since 2017 and I was involved in multiple research projects.</p>
        <p>I'm also playing professionally in League Of Legend for many teams.</p>
